1. Process management orchestrates the life cycle of tasks, from fork to exit, and relies on a run queue to decide which process acquires CPU time next. The kernel maintains metadata for each task in a structure called task_struct, recording identifiers, states, and scheduling parameters.

2. Memory management maps virtual addresses to physical frames through page tables, enabling isolation and efficient reuse of physical RAM. The buddy allocator pairs blocks of power-of-two sizes, minimizing fragmentation by coalescing neighbors when they become free.

3. File system code presents a hierarchical namespace so that files appear as nodes in a tree, each identified by an inode number. Journaling file systems like ext4 log intent before mutating data blocks, providing crash consistency akin to a write-ahead log in databases.

4. Device drivers encapsulate hardware details behind a common API, translating read and write calls into bus-specific transactions. The driver model categorizes devices by classes and assigns them to buses, allowing hot-plug events to be handled uniformly.

5. The networking stack frames data into packets and routes them across interfaces, supporting protocols from Ethernet to TCP/IP. Congestion control algorithms adjust transmission rates based on packet loss or delay, modeling network capacity as a dynamic feedback loop.

6. Inter-process communication mechanisms include pipes, message queues, and shared memory, each suited to different throughput and latency demands. Signals provide asynchronous notifications, implemented as a bitmask that the kernel checks on context switches.

7. System calls form the boundary between user programs and privileged operations, triggering a mode switch via software interrupt or fast syscall instruction. Argument validation guards against malformed inputs, preserving kernel integrity.

8. The virtual file system layer generalizes file operations so that diverse file system types can coexist beneath a unified interface. It maps generic operations like open and read to specific handlers in the underlying implementation.

9. CPU scheduling uses algorithms such as the Completely Fair Scheduler, which approximates an ideal multitasking system by tracking virtual runtime per task. Each task's share of CPU is proportional to its weight, balancing responsiveness and throughput.

10. Interrupt handling deals with hardware events by invoking registered handlers that execute in atomic context. The kernel distinguishes between maskable interrupts and non-maskable ones, prioritizing the latter to ensure critical events are serviced promptly.

11. Security modules such as SELinux or AppArmor enforce mandatory access controls by labeling subjects and objects with security contexts. Policy decisions reduce to lattice comparisons, granting access only when a request's label dominates the target's.

12. Namespaces partition global resources like process IDs, network interfaces, and mount points into isolated instances. Containers leverage namespaces to present each application with a private view of the system, avoiding identifier collisions.

13. Control groups aggregate processes into hierarchies where resource limits on CPU, memory, or I/O can be applied. Accounting counters measure usage, and when a limit is reached the scheduler throttles or terminates offending tasks.

14. Loadable kernel modules allow functionality to be added or removed at runtime, keeping the core small while enabling extensibility. Module symbols are resolved at load time, and reference counts prevent removal while code is in use.

15. Power management coordinates device states to balance performance with energy consumption, entering sleep states when idleness is detected. The kernel exposes governors that user space can tune to favor throughput or battery life.

16. Timekeeping subsystems derive system ticks from hardware timers and maintain monotonic and real-time clocks. High-resolution timers use nanosecond granularity, enabling precise scheduling for multimedia or networking applications.

17. Configuration options compiled into the kernel determine which subsystems and drivers are available, forming a binary tailored to its environment. Tools like Kconfig represent these options as a dependency graph to guide valid selections.

18. The boot process begins with firmware loading the kernel image, which then sets up protected mode, decompression, and memory maps before launching the initial process. Early printk support allows debugging output before the console drivers are active.

19. Tracing and debugging facilities such as ftrace or perf sample kernel events, providing visibility into scheduling latencies or cache misses. Data collected can be fed into statistical models to identify regressions or performance bottlenecks.

20. The build system orchestrates compilation through Makefiles that capture file dependencies and target architectures. Parallel builds exploit multi-core systems, and incremental recompilation shortens iteration cycles when only a subset of sources change.
